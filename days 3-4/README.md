# Statistical Analysis

## Overview

This notebook is designed as a hands-on exploration of various statistical concepts and methods applied to real-world data. It provides code examples and step-by-step guidance for performing statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression using Python. Each section focuses on a specific statistical method, allowing users to apply the learned concepts practically. 

I created this notebook with the aim of applying statistical concepts using Python while also reflecting on the deeper theoretical foundations through my own research and learning journey. By integrating resources from both textbooks and videos, I was able to cover essential topics such as mean, variance, hypothesis testing, and regression, and gain a comprehensive understanding of their importance and applications.

## Table of Contents

1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Computing basic statistics like the mean, variance, standard deviation, mode, and median (both manually and using built-in functions).
   - Visualizing distributions through histograms and boxplots.
   
2. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - **Z-Test**: Testing the difference between two sample means using Z-statistics on heart disease data.
   - **T-Test**: Performing a t-test on simulated normal distribution samples to assess significance.
   - **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: Conducting one-way ANOVA to test differences in cholesterol levels across various age groups in the heart disease dataset.
   
3. **Correlation and Regression**
   - Calculating a correlation matrix and visualizing pairwise relationships.
   - **Simple Linear Regression**: Modeling the relationship between body mass and flipper length in penguins.
   - **Multiple Linear Regression**: Extending the model to include bill length as a second predictor for body mass.
   - Visualizing the regression line and plane using both 2D and 3D plots.

## Resources Used

To grasp these concepts and understand their practical applications, I referred to the following high-quality resources:

### 1. **YouTube Channels**

#### **The Organic Chemistry Tutor**
- **Channel Link**: [The Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/@TheOrganicChemistryTutor)
- **Statistics Playlist**: [Statistics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0o_zxa4K1BVsziIRdfv4Hl4UIqDZhXWV)

The Organic Chemistry Tutor provides clear, beginner-friendly explanations of fundamental concepts in statistics. I used this playlist to reinforce my understanding of basic concepts such as mean, variance, and hypothesis testing. The visual and step-by-step approach makes it easier to grasp abstract ideas, especially when working with formulas.

#### **StatQuest with Josh Starmer**
- **Channel Link**: [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest)
- **Statistics Playlist**: [Statistics Fundamentals Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUK0FLuzwntyYI10UQFUhsY9)

StatQuest with Josh Starmer is one of the most insightful resources for understanding statistical concepts at a deeper level. I found Joshâ€™s intuitive breakdown of concepts such as linear regression and ANOVA especially useful. His ability to explain complex ideas with simple visuals and analogies significantly clarified my understanding, making it easier to implement these techniques in code.

### 2. **Textbook**
- **Book Reference**:  
  Janczyk, Markus, and Roland Pfister. *Understanding Inferential Statistics: From A for Significance Test to Z for Confidence Interval*. 1st ed. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, 2023.

This book provides a structured approach to inferential statistics and explains the theory behind various statistical tests and techniques. While it covers essential concepts very well, I found that I needed additional video resources (from the YouTube channels mentioned above) to fully digest some of the more complex topics. The book is great for understanding **why** we perform certain tests, but the videos helped me grasp the **how** in a cleaner, more interactive way.




By using both the textbook and the YouTube channels, I was able to achieve a well-rounded understanding of the concepts applied in this notebook. The videos offered a more interactive way to learn and visualize complex statistics, while the textbook provided depth, context, and theoretical explanations that are essential for a solid foundation.
